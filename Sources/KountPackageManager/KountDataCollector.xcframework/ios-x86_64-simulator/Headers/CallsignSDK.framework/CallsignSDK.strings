// There are 2 ways to localize the strings provided by the Callsign SDK:
// 1) Implement the CallsignSDKDelegate.callsignSDKLocalizedStringForKey API
// 2) Localize this file and add the localized versions to your application target as "Callsign.strings"
//
// Using the CallsignSDKDelegate API will allow you to change language dynamically.
// But even so, you should still use localized Callsign.strings to provide the localized strings.
